.. py:class:: CostExplorer.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS Cost Explorer Service::

    
    client = session.create_client('ce')

  
  These are the available methods:
  
  *   :py:meth:`~CostExplorer.Client.can_paginate`

  
  *   :py:meth:`~CostExplorer.Client.generate_presigned_url`

  
  *   :py:meth:`~CostExplorer.Client.get_cost_and_usage`

  
  *   :py:meth:`~CostExplorer.Client.get_dimension_values`

  
  *   :py:meth:`~CostExplorer.Client.get_paginator`

  
  *   :py:meth:`~CostExplorer.Client.get_reservation_utilization`

  
  *   :py:meth:`~CostExplorer.Client.get_tags`

  
  *   :py:meth:`~CostExplorer.Client.get_waiter`

  

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: generate_presigned_url(ClientMethod, Params=None, ExpiresIn=3600, HttpMethod=None)

        
    Generate a presigned url given a client, its method, and arguments
    
    :type ClientMethod: string
    :param ClientMethod: The client method to presign for
    
    :type Params: dict
    :param Params: The parameters normally passed to
        ``ClientMethod``.
    
    :type ExpiresIn: int
    :param ExpiresIn: The number of seconds the presigned url is valid
        for. By default it expires in an hour (3600 seconds)
    
    :type HttpMethod: string
    :param HttpMethod: The http method to use on the generated url. By
        default, the http method is whatever is used in the method's model.
    
    :returns: The presigned url


  .. py:method:: get_cost_and_usage(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieve cost and usage metrics for your account. You can specify which cost and usage-related metric, such as ``BlendedCosts`` or ``UsageQuantity`` , that you want the request to return. You can also filter and group your data by various dimensions, such as ``AWS Service`` or ``AvailabilityZone`` , in a specific time range. See the ``GetDimensionValues`` action for a complete list of the valid dimensions. Master accounts in an organization have access to all member accounts.

          ],
          NextPageToken='string'
      )
    :type TimePeriod: dict
    :param TimePeriod: 

      Sets the start and end dates for retrieving AWS costs. The start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example, if ``start`` is ``2017-01-01`` and ``end`` is ``2017-05-01`` , then the cost and usage data is retrieved from ``2017-01-01`` up to and including ``2017-04-30`` but not including ``2017-05-01`` .

      

    
      - **Start** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The beginning of the time period that you want the usage and costs for. The start date is inclusive. For example, if ``start`` is ``2017-01-01`` , then the cost and usage data is retrieved starting at ``2017-01-01`` up to the end date.

        

      
      - **End** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The end of the time period that you want the usage and costs for. The end date is exclusive. For example, if the ``end`` is ``2017-05-01`` , then the cost and usage data is retrieved from the start date but not including ``2017-05-01`` .

        

      
    
    :type Granularity: string
    :param Granularity: 

      Sets the AWS cost granularity to ``MONTHLY`` or ``DAILY`` .

      

    
    :type Filter: dict
    :param Filter: 

      Filters AWS costs by different dimensions. For example, you can specify ``Service`` and ``Linked Account`` and get the costs associated with that account's usage of that service. You can nest ``Expression`` objects to define any combination of dimension filters. For more information, see the ``Expression`` object or ``More Examples`` . 

      

    
      - **Or** *(list) --* 

        Return results that match either ``Dimension`` .

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Use ``Expression`` to filter by cost or by usage. There are two patterns: 

           

           
          * Simple dimension values - You can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. For example, you can filter for ``InstanceType==m4.xlarge OR InstanceType==c4.large`` . The ``Expression`` for that looks like this.  ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "InstanceType", "Values": [ "m4.xlarge", “c4.large” ] } }``   The list of dimension values are OR'd together to retrieve cost or usage data. You can create ``Expression`` and ``DimensionValues`` objects using either ``with*`` methods or ``set*`` methods in multiple lines.  
           
          * Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can use multiple ``Expression`` types and the logical operators ``AND/OR/NOT`` to create a list of one or more ``Expression`` objects. This allows you to filter on more advanced options. For example, you can filter on ``((InstanceType == m4.large OR InstanceType == m3.large) OR (Tag.Type == Type1)) AND (UsageType != DataTransfer)`` . The ``Expression`` for that looks like this.  ``{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "InstanceType", "Values": [ "m4.x.large", "c4.large" ] }}, {"Tag": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"dimensions": { "Key": "UsageType", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }``   

          .. note::

             Because each ``Expression`` can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an Expression object that will create an error. 

            ``{ "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension": "UsageType", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }``   
           

          

        
    
      - **And** *(list) --* 

        Return results that match both ``Dimension`` objects.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Use ``Expression`` to filter by cost or by usage. There are two patterns: 

           

           
          * Simple dimension values - You can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. For example, you can filter for ``InstanceType==m4.xlarge OR InstanceType==c4.large`` .

You can create ``Expression`` and ``DimensionValues`` objects using either ``with*`` methods or ``set*`` methods in multiple lines.  
           
          * Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can use multiple ``Expression`` types and the logical operators ``AND/OR/NOT`` to create a list of one or more ``Expression`` objects. This allows you to filter on more advanced options. For example, you can filter on ``((InstanceType == m4.large OR InstanceType == m3.large) OR (Tag.Type == Type1)) AND (UsageType != DataTransfer)`` . The ``Expression`` for that looks like this.  ``{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "InstanceType", "Values": [ "m4.x.large", "c4.large" ] }}, {"Tag": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"dimensions": { "Key": "UsageType", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }``   

          .. note::

             Because each ``Expression`` can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an Expression object that will create an error. 

            ``{ "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension": "UsageType", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }``   
           

          

        
    
      - **Not** *(dict) --* 

        Return results that don't match ``Dimension`` .

        

      
      - **Dimensions** *(dict) --* 

        The specific ``Dimension`` to use for ``Expression`` .

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* 

          The names of the metadata types that you can use to filter and group your results. For example, ``AZ`` returns a list of Availability Zones.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          The metadata values that you can use to filter and group your results. You can use ``GetDimensionValues`` to find specific values.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
      - **Tags** *(dict) --* 

        The specific ``Tag`` to use for ``Expression`` .

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* 

          The key for a tag.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          The specific value of a tag.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
    
    :type Metrics: list
    :param Metrics: 

      Which metrics are returned in the query. For more information about blended and unblended rates, see https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/blended-rates-intro/. 

       

      Valid values are ``BlendedCost`` , ``UnblendedCost`` , and ``UsageQuantity`` .

       

      .. note::

         

        If you return the ``UsageQuantity`` metric, the service aggregates all usage numbers without taking into account the units. For example, if you aggregate ``usageQuantity`` across all of EC2, the results aren't meaningful because EC2 compute hours and data transfer are measured in different units (for example, hours vs. GB). To get more meaningful ``UsageQuantity`` metrics, filter by ``UsageType`` or ``UsageTypeGroups`` . 

         

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type GroupBy: list
    :param GroupBy: 

      You can group AWS costs using up to two different groups, either dimensions, tag keys, or both.

       

      When you group by tag key, you get all tag values, including empty strings.

       

      Valid values are: ``AZ`` , ``INSTANCE_TYPE`` , ``LINKED_ACCCOUNT`` , ``OPERATION`` , ``PURCHASE_TYPE`` , ``SERVICE`` , ``USAGE_TYPE`` , ``TAGS`` , and ``PLATFORM`` .

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents a group when you specify a group by criteria, or in the response to a query with a specific grouping.

        

      
        - **Type** *(string) --* 

          The string that represents the type of group.

          

        
        - **Key** *(string) --* 

          The string that represents a key for a specified group.

          

        
      
  
    :type NextPageToken: string
    :param NextPageToken: 

      The token to retrieve the next set of results. AWS provides the token when the response from a previous call has more results than the maximum page size.

    :param TimePeriod: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Sets the start and end dates for retrieving reserve instance (RI) utilization. The start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example, if ``start`` is ``2017-01-01`` and ``end`` is ``2017-05-01`` , then the cost and usage data is retrieved from ``2017-01-01`` up to and including ``2017-04-30`` but not including ``2017-05-01`` . 

      

    
      - **Start** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The beginning of the time period that you want the usage and costs for. The start date is inclusive. For example, if ``start`` is ``2017-01-01`` , then the cost and usage data is retrieved starting at ``2017-01-01`` up to the end date.

    :param GroupBy: 

      Groups only by ``SubscriptionId`` . Metadata is included.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents a group when you specify a group by criteria, or in the response to a query with a specific grouping.

        

      
        - **Type** *(string) --* 

          The string that represents the type of group.

          

        
        - **Key** *(string) --* 

          The string that represents a key for a specified group.

          

        
      
  
    :type Granularity: string
    :param Granularity: 

      Sets the AWS cost granularity to ``MONTHLY`` or ``DAILY`` . If both ``GroupBy`` and ``granularity`` are not set, ``GetReservationUtilization`` defaults to ``DAILY`` . If ``GroupBy`` is set, ``Granularity`` can't be set, and the response object doesn't include ``MONTHLY`` or ``DAILY`` granularity.

      

    
    :type Filter: dict
    :param Filter: 

      Filters utilization data by using different dimensions. ``GetReservationUtilization`` uses the same ``Expression`` object as the other operations, but only ``AND`` is supported among each dimension, and nesting is supported up to only one level deep. If there are multiple values for a dimension, they are OR'd together.

      

    
      - **Or** *(list) --* 

        Return results that match either ``Dimension`` .

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Use ``Expression`` to filter by cost or by usage. There are two patterns: 

           

           
          * Simple dimension values - You can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. For example, you can filter for ``InstanceType==m4.xlarge OR InstanceType==c4.large`` . The ``Expression`` for that looks like this.  ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "InstanceType", "Values": [ "m4.xlarge", “c4.large” ] } }``   The list of dimension values are OR'd together to retrieve cost or usage data. You can create ``Expression`` and ``DimensionValues`` objects using either ``with*`` methods or ``set*`` methods in multiple lines.  
           
          * Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can use multiple ``Expression`` types and the logical operators ``AND/OR/NOT`` to create a list of one or more ``Expression`` objects. This allows you to filter on more advanced options. For example, you can filter on ``((InstanceType == m4.large OR InstanceType == m3.large) OR (Tag.Type == Type1)) AND (UsageType != DataTransfer)`` . The ``Expression`` for that looks like this.  ``{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "InstanceType", "Values": [ "m4.x.large", "c4.large" ] }}, {"Tag": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"dimensions": { "Key": "UsageType", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }``   

          .. note::

             Because each ``Expression`` can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an Expression object that will create an error. 

            ``{ "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension": "UsageType", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }``   
           

          

        
    
      - **And** *(list) --* 

        Return results that match both ``Dimension`` objects.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Use ``Expression`` to filter by cost or by usage. There are two patterns:

          The names of the metadata types that you can use to filter and group your results. For example, ``AZ`` returns a list of Availability Zones.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          The metadata values that you can use to filter and group your results. You can use ``GetDimensionValues`` to find specific values.
