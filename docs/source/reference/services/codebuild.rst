                * For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the build spec (for example, ``https://git-codecommit.*region-ID* .amazonaws.com/v1/repos/*repo-name* `` ). 
                 
                * For source code in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) input bucket, the path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, `` *bucket-name* /*path* /*to* /*object-name* .zip`` ) 
                 
                * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page that displays, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to. Then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
                 
                * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page that displays, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` .

                      We strongly discourage using environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. Environment variables can be displayed in plain text using tools such as the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

              - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

                If set to true, enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container; otherwise, false or not specified (the default). This value must be set to true only if this build project will be used to build Docker images, and the specified build environment image is not one provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support. Otherwise, all associated builds that attempt to interact with the Docker daemon will fail. Note that you must also start the Docker daemon so that your builds can interact with it as needed. One way to do this is to initialize the Docker daemon in the install phase of your build spec by running the following build commands. (Do not run the following build commands if the specified build environment image is provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support.)

                 

                 ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay& - timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``

              - **type** *(string) --* 

                The type of repository that contains the source code to be built. Valid values include:

                 

                 
                * ``BITBUCKET`` : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository. 
                 
                * ``CODECOMMIT`` : The source code is in an AWS CodeCommit repository. 
                 
                * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The source code settings are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline.

              - **location** *(string) --* 

                Information about the location of the source code to be built. Valid values include:

                 

                 
                * For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, ``location`` should not be specified. If it is specified, AWS CodePipeline will ignore it. This is because AWS CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value. 
                 
                * For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the build spec (for example, ``https://git-codecommit.*region-ID* .amazonaws.com/v1/repos/*repo-name* `` ). 
                 
                * For source code in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) input bucket, the path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, `` *bucket-name* /*path* /*to* /*object-name* .zip`` ) 
                 
                * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page that displays, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to. Then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
                 
                * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page that displays, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
                 

                
              

              - **buildspec** *(string) --* 

                The build spec declaration to use for the builds in this build project.

                 

                If this value is not specified, a build spec must be included along with the source code to be built.

                
              

              - **auth** *(dict) --* 

                Information about the authorization settings for AWS CodeBuild to access the source code to be built.

                 

                This information is for the AWS CodeBuild console's use only. Your code should not get or set this information directly (unless the build project's source ``type`` value is ``BITBUCKET`` or ``GITHUB`` ).

                
                

                - **type** *(string) --* 

                  The authorization type to use. The only valid value is ``OAUTH`` , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

                  
                

                - **resource** *(string) --*

              Information about the build output artifacts for the build project.

              
              

              - **type** *(string) --* 

                The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

                 

                 
                * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The build project will have build output generated through AWS CodePipeline. 
                 
                * ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` : The build project will not produce any build output. 
                 
                * ``S3`` : The build project will store build output in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). 
                 

                
              

              - **location** *(string) --* 

                Information about the build output artifact location, as follows:

                 

                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
                 

                
              

              - **path** *(string) --* 

                Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to name and store the output artifact, as follows:

                 

                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, then ``path`` will not be used. 
                 

                 

                For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

                
              

              - **namespaceType** *(string) --* 

                Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to determine the name and location to store the output artifact, as follows:

                 

                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , then valid values include: 

                   
                  * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
                   
                  * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
                   

                 
                 

                 

                For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* /MyArtifact.zip`` .

                
              

              - **name** *(string) --* 

                Along with ``path`` and ``namespaceType`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to name and store the output artifact, as follows:

                 

                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild.

                * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. 
                 

                 

                For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* /MyArtifact.zip`` .

                
              

              - **packaging** *(string) --* 

                The type of build output artifact to create, as follows:

                 

                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
                 
                * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

                   
                  * ``NONE`` : AWS CodeBuild will create in the output bucket a folder containing the build output. This is the default if ``packaging`` is not specified. 
                   
                  * ``ZIP`` : AWS CodeBuild will create in the output bucket a ZIP file containing the build output.

                    .. warning::

                       

                      We strongly discourage using environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. Environment variables can be displayed in plain text using tools such as the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

                       

                    
                  

                  - **type** *(string) --* 

                    The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

              - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

                If set to true, enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container; otherwise, false or not specified (the default). This value must be set to true only if this build project will be used to build Docker images, and the specified build environment image is not one provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support. Otherwise, all associated builds that attempt to interact with the Docker daemon will fail. Note that you must also start the Docker daemon so that your builds can interact with it as needed. One way to do this is to initialize the Docker daemon in the install phase of your build spec by running the following build commands. (Do not run the following build commands if the specified build environment image is provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support.)

                 

                 ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay& - timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``

            - **timeoutInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

              How long, in minutes, from 5 to 480 (8 hours), for AWS CodeBuild to wait before timing out any related build that did not get marked as completed. The default is 60 minutes.

              
            

            - **encryptionKey** *(string) --* 

              The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to be used for encrypting the build output artifacts.

               

              This is expressed either as the CMK's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or, if specified, the CMK's alias (using the format ``alias/*alias-name* `` ).

              
            

            - **tags** *(list) --* 

              The tags for this build project.

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: create_project(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a build project.

    :param description: 

      A description that makes the build project easy to identify.

      

    
    :type source: dict
    :param source: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Information about the build input source code for the build project.

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of repository that contains the source code to be built. Valid values include:

         

         
        * ``BITBUCKET`` : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository. 
         
        * ``CODECOMMIT`` : The source code is in an AWS CodeCommit repository. 
         
        * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The source code settings are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline. 
         
        * ``GITHUB`` : The source code is in a GitHub repository. 
         
        * ``S3`` : The source code is in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) input bucket. 
         

        

      
      - **location** *(string) --* 

        Information about the location of the source code to be built. Valid values include:

         

         
        * For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, ``location`` should not be specified. If it is specified, AWS CodePipeline will ignore it. This is because AWS CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value. 
         
        * For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the build spec (for example, ``https://git-codecommit.*region-ID* .amazonaws.com/v1/repos/*repo-name* `` ). 
         
        * For source code in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) input bucket, the path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, `` *bucket-name* /*path* /*to* /*object-name* .zip`` ) 
         
        * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page that displays, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to. Then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
         
        * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page that displays, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
         

        

      
      - **buildspec** *(string) --* 

        The build spec declaration to use for the builds in this build project.

         

        If this value is not specified, a build spec must be included along with the source code to be built.

        

      
      - **auth** *(dict) --* 

        Information about the authorization settings for AWS CodeBuild to access the source code to be built.

         

        This information is for the AWS CodeBuild console's use only. Your code should not get or set this information directly (unless the build project's source ``type`` value is ``BITBUCKET`` or ``GITHUB`` ).

        

      
        - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The authorization type to use. The only valid value is ``OAUTH`` , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

          

        
        - **resource** *(string) --* 

          The resource value that applies to the specified authorization type.

          

        
      
    
    :type artifacts: dict
    :param artifacts: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Information about the build output artifacts for the build project.

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

         

         
        * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The build project will have build output generated through AWS CodePipeline. 
         
        * ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` : The build project will not produce any build output. 
         
        * ``S3`` : The build project will store build output in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). 
         

        

      
      - **location** *(string) --* 

        Information about the build output artifact location, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
         

        

      
      - **path** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to name and store the output artifact, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, then ``path`` will not be used. 
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **namespaceType** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to determine the name and location to store the output artifact, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , then valid values include: 

           
          * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
           
          * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
           

         
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* /MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **name** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``path`` and ``namespaceType`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to name and store the output artifact, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. 
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* /MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **packaging** *(string) --* 

        The type of build output artifact to create, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

           
          * ``NONE`` : AWS CodeBuild will create in the output bucket a folder containing the build output. This is the default if ``packaging`` is not specified. 
           
          * ``ZIP`` : AWS CodeBuild will create in the output bucket a ZIP file containing the build output. 
           

         
         

        

      
    
    :type cache: dict
    :param cache:

      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of cache used by the build project. Valid values include:

         

         
        * ``NO_CACHE`` : The build project will not use any cache. 
         
        * ``S3`` : The build project will read and write from/to S3. 
         

        

      
      - **location** *(string) --* 

        Information about the cache location, as follows: 

         

         
        * ``NO_CACHE`` : This value will be ignored. 
         
        * ``S3`` : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix. 
         

        

      
    
    :type environment: dict
    :param environment: **[REQUIRED]**

            The value of the environment variable.

             

            .. warning::

               

              We strongly discourage using environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. Environment variables can be displayed in plain text using tools such as the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

               

            

          
          - **type** *(string) --* 

            The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

             

             
            * ``PARAMETER_STORE`` : An environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. 
             
            * ``PLAINTEXT`` : An environment variable in plaintext format. 
             

            

          
        
    
      - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

        If set to true, enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container; otherwise, false or not specified (the default). This value must be set to true only if this build project will be used to build Docker images, and the specified build environment image is not one provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support. Otherwise, all associated builds that attempt to interact with the Docker daemon will fail. Note that you must also start the Docker daemon so that your builds can interact with it as needed. One way to do this is to initialize the Docker daemon in the install phase of your build spec by running the following build commands. (Do not run the following build commands if the specified build environment image is provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support.)

         

         ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay& - timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``

            - **location** *(string) --* 

              Information about the location of the source code to be built. Valid values include:

               

               
              * For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, ``location`` should not be specified. If it is specified, AWS CodePipeline will ignore it. This is because AWS CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value. 
               
              * For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the build spec (for example, ``https://git-codecommit.*region-ID* .amazonaws.com/v1/repos/*repo-name* `` ). 
               
              * For source code in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) input bucket, the path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, `` *bucket-name* /*path* /*to* /*object-name* .zip`` ) 
               
              * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page that displays, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to. Then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
               
              * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page that displays, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
               

              
            

            - **buildspec** *(string) --* 

              The build spec declaration to use for the builds in this build project.

               

              If this value is not specified, a build spec must be included along with the source code to be built.

              
            

            - **auth** *(dict) --* 

              Information about the authorization settings for AWS CodeBuild to access the source code to be built.

               

              This information is for the AWS CodeBuild console's use only. Your code should not get or set this information directly (unless the build project's source ``type`` value is ``BITBUCKET`` or ``GITHUB`` ).

              
              

              - **type** *(string) --* 

                The authorization type to use. The only valid value is ``OAUTH`` , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

            - **type** *(string) --* 

              The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

               

               
              * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The build project will have build output generated through AWS CodePipeline. 
               
              * ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` : The build project will not produce any build output. 
               
              * ``S3`` : The build project will store build output in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). 
               

              
            

            - **location** *(string) --* 

              Information about the build output artifact location, as follows:

               

               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
               

              
            

            - **path** *(string) --* 

              Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to name and store the output artifact, as follows:

               

               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, then ``path`` will not be used. 
               

               

              For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

              
            

            - **namespaceType** *(string) --* 

              Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to determine the name and location to store the output artifact, as follows:

               

               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , then valid values include: 

                 
                * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
                 
                * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
                 

               
               

               

              For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* /MyArtifact.zip`` .

              
            

            - **name** *(string) --* 

              Along with ``path`` and ``namespaceType`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to name and store the output artifact, as follows:

               

               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. 
               

               

              For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* /MyArtifact.zip`` .

                    We strongly discourage using environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. Environment variables can be displayed in plain text using tools such as the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

            - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

              If set to true, enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container; otherwise, false or not specified (the default). This value must be set to true only if this build project will be used to build Docker images, and the specified build environment image is not one provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support. Otherwise, all associated builds that attempt to interact with the Docker daemon will fail. Note that you must also start the Docker daemon so that your builds can interact with it as needed. One way to do this is to initialize the Docker daemon in the install phase of your build spec by running the following build commands. (Do not run the following build commands if the specified build environment image is provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support.)

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay& - timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``

          - **timeoutInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

            How long, in minutes, from 5 to 480 (8 hours), for AWS CodeBuild to wait before timing out any related build that did not get marked as completed. The default is 60 minutes.

            
          

          - **encryptionKey** *(string) --* 

            The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to be used for encrypting the build output artifacts.

             

            This is expressed either as the CMK's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or, if specified, the CMK's alias (using the format ``alias/*alias-name* `` ).

            
          

          - **tags** *(list) --* 

            The tags for this build project.

              - **key** *(string) --* 

                The tag's key.

                
              

              - **value** *(string) --* 

                The tag's value.

                
          
        
          

          - **created** *(datetime) --* 

            When the build project was created, expressed in Unix time format.

            
          

          - **lastModified** *(datetime) --*

  .. py:method:: create_webhook(**kwargs)

    

    For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored in a GitHub repository, enables AWS CodeBuild to begin automatically rebuilding the source code every time a code change is pushed to the repository.

     

    .. warning::

       

      If you enable webhooks for an AWS CodeBuild project, and the project is used as a build step in AWS CodePipeline, then two identical builds will be created for each commit. One build is triggered through webhooks, and one through AWS CodePipeline. Because billing is on a per-build basis, you will be billed for both builds. Therefore, if you are using AWS CodePipeline, we recommend that you disable webhooks in CodeBuild. In the AWS CodeBuild console, clear the Webhook box. For more information, see step 9 in `Change a Build Project’s Settings <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/change-project.html#change-project-console>`__ .

      A version of the build input to be built, for this build only. If not specified, the latest version will be used. If specified, must be one of:

       

       
      * For AWS CodeCommit: the commit ID to use. 
       
      * For GitHub: the commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format ``pr/pull-request-ID`` (for example ``pr/25`` ). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID will be used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID will be used. 
       
      * For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID will be used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID will be used. 
       
      * For Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3): the version ID of the object representing the build input ZIP file to use. 
       

      

    
    :type artifactsOverride: dict
    :param artifactsOverride: 

      Build output artifact settings that override, for this build only, the latest ones already defined in the build project.

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

         

         
        * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The build project will have build output generated through AWS CodePipeline. 
         
        * ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` : The build project will not produce any build output. 
         
        * ``S3`` : The build project will store build output in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). 
         

        

      
      - **location** *(string) --* 

        Information about the build output artifact location, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
         

        

      
      - **path** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to name and store the output artifact, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, then ``path`` will not be used. 
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **namespaceType** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to determine the name and location to store the output artifact, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , then valid values include: 

           
          * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
           
          * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
           

         
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* /MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **name** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``path`` and ``namespaceType`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to name and store the output artifact, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. 
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* /MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **packaging** *(string) --* 

        The type of build output artifact to create, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

           
          * ``NONE`` : AWS CodeBuild will create in the output bucket a folder containing the build output. This is the default if ``packaging`` is not specified. 
           
          * ``ZIP`` : AWS CodeBuild will create in the output bucket a ZIP file containing the build output. 
           

         
         

        

      
    
    :type environmentVariablesOverride: list
    :param environmentVariablesOverride: 

      A set of environment variables that overrides, for this build only, the latest ones already defined in the build project.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Information about an environment variable for a build project or a build.

        

      
        - **name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name or key of the environment variable.

          

        
        - **value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value of the environment variable.

           

          .. warning::

             

            We strongly discourage using environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. Environment variables can be displayed in plain text using tools such as the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

             

          

        
        - **type** *(string) --* 

          The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

           

           
          * ``PARAMETER_STORE`` : An environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. 
           
          * ``PLAINTEXT`` : An environment variable in plaintext format. 
           

          

        
      
  
    :type buildspecOverride: string
    :param buildspecOverride:

    :type timeoutInMinutesOverride: integer
    :param timeoutInMinutesOverride: 

      The number of build timeout minutes, from 5 to 480 (8 hours), that overrides, for this build only, the latest setting already defined in the build project.

              * For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, ``location`` should not be specified. If it is specified, AWS CodePipeline will ignore it. This is because AWS CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value. 
               
              * For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the build spec (for example, ``https://git-codecommit.*region-ID* .amazonaws.com/v1/repos/*repo-name* `` ). 
               
              * For source code in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) input bucket, the path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, `` *bucket-name* /*path* /*to* /*object-name* .zip`` ) 
               
              * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec.

Then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
               
              * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page that displays, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` .

            - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

              If set to true, enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container; otherwise, false or not specified (the default). This value must be set to true only if this build project will be used to build Docker images, and the specified build environment image is not one provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support. Otherwise, all associated builds that attempt to interact with the Docker daemon will fail. Note that you must also start the Docker daemon so that your builds can interact with it as needed. One way to do this is to initialize the Docker daemon in the install phase of your build spec by running the following build commands. (Do not run the following build commands if the specified build environment image is provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support.)

              * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page that displays, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to. Then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
               
              * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page that displays, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` .

                    We strongly discourage using environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. Environment variables can be displayed in plain text using tools such as the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

            - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

              If set to true, enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container; otherwise, false or not specified (the default). This value must be set to true only if this build project will be used to build Docker images, and the specified build environment image is not one provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support. Otherwise, all associated builds that attempt to interact with the Docker daemon will fail. Note that you must also start the Docker daemon so that your builds can interact with it as needed. One way to do this is to initialize the Docker daemon in the install phase of your build spec by running the following build commands. (Do not run the following build commands if the specified build environment image is provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support.)

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay& - timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``

          - **buildComplete** *(boolean) --* 

            Whether the build has finished. True if completed; otherwise, false.

            
          

          - **initiator** *(string) --* 

            The entity that started the build. Valid values include:

             

             
            * If AWS CodePipeline started the build, the pipeline's name (for example, ``codepipeline/my-demo-pipeline`` ). 
             
            * If an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user started the build, the user's name (for example ``MyUserName`` ). 
             
            * If the Jenkins plugin for AWS CodeBuild started the build, the string ``CodeBuild-Jenkins-Plugin`` . 
             

            
          

          - **vpcConfig** *(dict) --* 

            If your AWS CodeBuild project accesses resources in an Amazon VPC, you provide this parameter that identifies the VPC ID and the list of security group IDs and subnet IDs.

    :type source: dict
    :param source: 

      Information to be changed about the build input source code for the build project.

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of repository that contains the source code to be built. Valid values include:

         

         
        * ``BITBUCKET`` : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository. 
         
        * ``CODECOMMIT`` : The source code is in an AWS CodeCommit repository. 
         
        * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The source code settings are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline. 
         
        * ``GITHUB`` : The source code is in a GitHub repository. 
         
        * ``S3`` : The source code is in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) input bucket. 
         

        

      
      - **location** *(string) --* 

        Information about the location of the source code to be built. Valid values include:

         

         
        * For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, ``location`` should not be specified. If it is specified, AWS CodePipeline will ignore it. This is because AWS CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value. 
         
        * For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the build spec (for example, ``https://git-codecommit.*region-ID* .amazonaws.com/v1/repos/*repo-name* `` ). 
         
        * For source code in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) input bucket, the path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, `` *bucket-name* /*path* /*to* /*object-name* .zip`` ) 
         
        * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page that displays, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to. Then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
         
        * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page that displays, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
         

        

      
      - **buildspec** *(string) --* 

        The build spec declaration to use for the builds in this build project.

         

        If this value is not specified, a build spec must be included along with the source code to be built.

        

      
      - **auth** *(dict) --* 

        Information about the authorization settings for AWS CodeBuild to access the source code to be built.

         

        This information is for the AWS CodeBuild console's use only. Your code should not get or set this information directly (unless the build project's source ``type`` value is ``BITBUCKET`` or ``GITHUB`` ).

        

      
        - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The authorization type to use. The only valid value is ``OAUTH`` , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

          

        
        - **resource** *(string) --* 

          The resource value that applies to the specified authorization type.

          

        
      
    
    :type artifacts: dict
    :param artifacts: 

      Information to be changed about the build output artifacts for the build project.

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

         

         
        * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The build project will have build output generated through AWS CodePipeline. 
         
        * ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` : The build project will not produce any build output. 
         
        * ``S3`` : The build project will store build output in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). 
         

        

      
      - **location** *(string) --* 

        Information about the build output artifact location, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
         

        

      
      - **path** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to name and store the output artifact, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, then ``path`` will not be used. 
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **namespaceType** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to determine the name and location to store the output artifact, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , then valid values include: 

           
          * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
           
          * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
           

         
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* /MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **name** *(string) --* 

        Along with ``path`` and ``namespaceType`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to name and store the output artifact, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. 
         

         

        For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* /MyArtifact.zip`` .

        

      
      - **packaging** *(string) --* 

        The type of build output artifact to create, as follows:

         

         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
         
        * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

           
          * ``NONE`` : AWS CodeBuild will create in the output bucket a folder containing the build output. This is the default if ``packaging`` is not specified. 
           
          * ``ZIP`` : AWS CodeBuild will create in the output bucket a ZIP file containing the build output.

            .. warning::

               

              We strongly discourage using environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. Environment variables can be displayed in plain text using tools such as the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

               

            

          
          - **type** *(string) --* 

            The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

             

             
            * ``PARAMETER_STORE`` : An environment variable stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. 
             
            * ``PLAINTEXT`` : An environment variable in plaintext format. 
             

            

          
        
    
      - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

        If set to true, enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container; otherwise, false or not specified (the default). This value must be set to true only if this build project will be used to build Docker images, and the specified build environment image is not one provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support. Otherwise, all associated builds that attempt to interact with the Docker daemon will fail. Note that you must also start the Docker daemon so that your builds can interact with it as needed. One way to do this is to initialize the Docker daemon in the install phase of your build spec by running the following build commands. (Do not run the following build commands if the specified build environment image is provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support.)

         

         ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay& - timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``  

        

      
    
    :type serviceRole: string
    :param serviceRole: 

      The replacement ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that enables AWS CodeBuild to interact with dependent AWS services on behalf of the AWS account.

      

    
    :type timeoutInMinutes: integer
    :param timeoutInMinutes: 

      The replacement value in minutes, from 5 to 480 (8 hours), for AWS CodeBuild to wait before timing out any related build that did not get marked as completed.

      

    
    :type encryptionKey: string
    :param encryptionKey: 

      The replacement AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to be used for encrypting the build output artifacts.

       

      You can specify either the CMK's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or, if available, the CMK's alias (using the format ``alias/*alias-name* `` ).

      

    
    :type tags: list
    :param tags: 

      The replacement set of tags for this build project.

       

      These tags are available for use by AWS services that support AWS CodeBuild build project tags.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A tag, consisting of a key and a value.

         

        This tag is available for use by AWS services that support tags in AWS CodeBuild.

              The type of repository that contains the source code to be built. Valid values include:

               

               
              * ``BITBUCKET`` : The source code is in a Bitbucket repository. 
               
              * ``CODECOMMIT`` : The source code is in an AWS CodeCommit repository. 
               
              * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The source code settings are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline.

              * ``S3`` : The source code is in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) input bucket. 
               

              
            

            - **location** *(string) --* 

              Information about the location of the source code to be built. Valid values include:

               

               
              * For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, ``location`` should not be specified. If it is specified, AWS CodePipeline will ignore it. This is because AWS CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value. 
               
              * For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the build spec (for example, ``https://git-codecommit.*region-ID* .amazonaws.com/v1/repos/*repo-name* `` ). 
               
              * For source code in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) input bucket, the path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, `` *bucket-name* /*path* /*to* /*object-name* .zip`` ) 
               
              * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page that displays, for **Organization access** , choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to. Then choose **Authorize application** . (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
               
              * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. To do this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page that displays, choose **Grant access** . (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the ``source`` object, set the ``auth`` object's ``type`` value to ``OAUTH`` . 
               

              
            

            - **buildspec** *(string) --* 

              The build spec declaration to use for the builds in this build project.

               

              If this value is not specified, a build spec must be included along with the source code to be built.

              
            

            - **auth** *(dict) --* 

              Information about the authorization settings for AWS CodeBuild to access the source code to be built.

               

              This information is for the AWS CodeBuild console's use only. Your code should not get or set this information directly (unless the build project's source ``type`` value is ``BITBUCKET`` or ``GITHUB`` ).

              
              

              - **type** *(string) --* 

                The authorization type to use. The only valid value is ``OAUTH`` , which represents the OAuth authorization type.

                
              

              - **resource** *(string) --* 

                The resource value that applies to the specified authorization type.

                
          
        
          

          - **artifacts** *(dict) --* 

            Information about the build output artifacts for the build project.

            
            

            - **type** *(string) --* 

              The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:

               

               
              * ``CODEPIPELINE`` : The build project will have build output generated through AWS CodePipeline. 
               
              * ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` : The build project will not produce any build output. 
               
              * ``S3`` : The build project will store build output in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). 
               

              
            

            - **location** *(string) --* 

              Information about the build output artifact location, as follows:

               

               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output bucket. 
               

              
            

            - **path** *(string) --* 

              Along with ``namespaceType`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to name and store the output artifact, as follows:

               

               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the path to the output artifact. If ``path`` is not specified, then ``path`` will not be used. 
               

               

              For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``NONE`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in the output bucket at ``MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip`` .

              
            

            - **namespaceType** *(string) --* 

              Along with ``path`` and ``name`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to determine the name and location to store the output artifact, as follows:

               

               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , then valid values include: 

                 
                * ``BUILD_ID`` : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact. 
                 
                * ``NONE`` : Do not include the build ID. This is the default if ``namespaceType`` is not specified. 
                 

               
               

               

              For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* /MyArtifact.zip`` .

              
            

            - **name** *(string) --* 

              Along with ``path`` and ``namespaceType`` , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to name and store the output artifact, as follows:

               

               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , this is the name of the output artifact object. 
               

               

              For example, if ``path`` is set to ``MyArtifacts`` , ``namespaceType`` is set to ``BUILD_ID`` , and ``name`` is set to ``MyArtifact.zip`` , then the output artifact would be stored in ``MyArtifacts/*build-ID* /MyArtifact.zip`` .

              
            

            - **packaging** *(string) --* 

              The type of build output artifact to create, as follows:

               

               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``CODEPIPELINE`` , then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``NO_ARTIFACTS`` , then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced. 
               
              * If ``type`` is set to ``S3`` , valid values include: 

                 
                * ``NONE`` : AWS CodeBuild will create in the output bucket a folder containing the build output. This is the default if ``packaging`` is not specified. 
                 
                * ``ZIP`` : AWS CodeBuild will create in the output bucket a ZIP file containing the build output. 
                 

               
               

              
        
          

          - **cache** *(dict) --*

              * ``NO_CACHE`` : The build project will not use any cache. 
               
              * ``S3`` : The build project will read and write from/to S3. 
               

              
            

            - **location** *(string) --* 

              Information about the cache location, as follows: 

               

               
              * ``NO_CACHE`` : This value will be ignored. 
               
              * ``S3`` : This is the S3 bucket name/prefix.

                    We strongly discourage using environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. Environment variables can be displayed in plain text using tools such as the AWS CodeBuild console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

            - **privilegedMode** *(boolean) --* 

              If set to true, enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container; otherwise, false or not specified (the default). This value must be set to true only if this build project will be used to build Docker images, and the specified build environment image is not one provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support. Otherwise, all associated builds that attempt to interact with the Docker daemon will fail. Note that you must also start the Docker daemon so that your builds can interact with it as needed. One way to do this is to initialize the Docker daemon in the install phase of your build spec by running the following build commands. (Do not run the following build commands if the specified build environment image is provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support.)

               

               ``- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay& - timeout -t 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"``
