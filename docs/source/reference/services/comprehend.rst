              The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for a collection of data files. 

               

              For example, if you use the URI ``S3://bucketName/prefix`` , if the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

              * ``ONE_DOC_PER_LINE`` - Each line in a file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing many short documents, such as text messages. 
               

              
        
          

          - **OutputDataConfig** *(dict) --*

              The service creates an output file called ``output.tar.gz`` . It is a compressed archive that contains two files, ``topic-terms.csv`` that lists the terms associated with each topic, and ``doc-topics.csv`` that lists the documents associated with each topic. For more information, see  topic-modeling .

  .. py:method:: generate_presigned_url(ClientMethod, Params=None, ExpiresIn=3600, HttpMethod=None)

        
    Generate a presigned url given a client, its method, and arguments

    :param ClientMethod: The client method to presign for
    
    :type Params: dict
    :param Params: The parameters normally passed to
        ``ClientMethod``.
    
    :type ExpiresIn: int
    :param ExpiresIn: The number of seconds the presigned url is valid
        for. By default it expires in an hour (3600 seconds)
    
    :type HttpMethod: string

  .. py:method:: get_paginator(operation_name)

        
    Create a paginator for an operation.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :raise OperationNotPageableError: Raised if the operation is not
        pageable.  You can use the ``client.can_paginate`` method to

                The service creates an output file called ``output.tar.gz`` . It is a compressed archive that contains two files, ``topic-terms.csv`` that lists the terms associated with each topic, and ``doc-topics.csv`` that lists the documents associated with each topic. For more information, see  topic-modeling .
