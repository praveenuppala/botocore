  .. py:method:: allocate_public_virtual_interface(**kwargs)

    

    Provisions a public virtual interface to be owned by a different customer.

     

    The owner of a connection calls this function to provision a public virtual interface which will be owned by another AWS customer.

     

    Virtual interfaces created using this function must be confirmed by the virtual interface owner by calling ConfirmPublicVirtualInterface. Until this step has been completed, the virtual interface will be in 'Confirming' state, and will not be available for handling traffic.

     

    When creating an IPv6 public virtual interface (addressFamily is 'ipv6'), the customer and amazon address fields should be left blank to use auto-assigned IPv6 space. Custom IPv6 Addresses are currently not supported.

  .. py:method:: associate_connection_with_lag(**kwargs)

    

    Associates an existing connection with a link aggregation group (LAG). The connection is interrupted and re-established as a member of the LAG (connectivity to AWS will be interrupted). The connection must be hosted on the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint as the LAG, and its bandwidth must match the bandwidth for the LAG. You can reassociate a connection that's currently associated with a different LAG; however, if removing the connection will cause the original LAG to fall below its setting for minimum number of operational connections, the request fails.

     

    Any virtual interfaces that are directly associated with the connection are automatically re-associated with the LAG. If the connection was originally associated with a different LAG, the virtual interfaces remain associated with the original LAG.

     

    For interconnects, any hosted connections are automatically re-associated with the LAG. If the interconnect was originally associated with a different LAG, the hosted connections remain associated with the original LAG.

  .. py:method:: associate_virtual_interface(**kwargs)

    

    Associates a virtual interface with a specified link aggregation group (LAG) or connection. Connectivity to AWS is temporarily interrupted as the virtual interface is being migrated. If the target connection or LAG has an associated virtual interface with a conflicting VLAN number or a conflicting IP address, the operation fails. 

     

    Virtual interfaces associated with a hosted connection cannot be associated with a LAG; hosted connections must be migrated along with their virtual interfaces using  AssociateHostedConnection .

     

    In order to reassociate a virtual interface to a new connection or LAG, the requester must own either the virtual interface itself or the connection to which the virtual interface is currently associated. Additionally, the requester must own the connection or LAG to which the virtual interface will be newly associated.

  .. py:method:: create_bgp_peer(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new BGP peer on a specified virtual interface. The BGP peer cannot be in the same address family (IPv4/IPv6) of an existing BGP peer on the virtual interface.

     

    You must create a BGP peer for the corresponding address family in order to access AWS resources that also use that address family.

     

    When creating a IPv6 BGP peer, the Amazon address and customer address fields must be left blank. IPv6 addresses are automatically assigned from Amazon's pool of IPv6 addresses; you cannot specify custom IPv6 addresses.

     

    For a public virtual interface, the Autonomous System Number (ASN) must be private or already whitelisted for the virtual interface.

  .. py:method:: create_connection(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new connection between the customer network and a specific AWS Direct Connect location.

     

    A connection links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. An AWS Direct Connect location provides access to Amazon Web Services in the region it is associated with. You can establish connections with AWS Direct Connect locations in multiple regions, but a connection in one region does not provide connectivity to other regions.

     

    To find the locations for your region, use  DescribeLocations .

     

    You can automatically add the new connection to a link aggregation group (LAG) by specifying a LAG ID in the request. This ensures that the new connection is allocated on the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint that hosts the specified LAG. If there are no available ports on the endpoint, the request fails and no connection will be created.

    Creates a new direct connect gateway. A direct connect gateway is an intermediate object that enables you to connect a set of virtual interfaces and virtual private gateways. direct connect gateways are global and visible in any AWS region after they are created. The virtual interfaces and virtual private gateways that are connected through a direct connect gateway can be in different regions. This enables you to connect to a VPC in any region, regardless of the region in which the virtual interfaces are located, and pass traffic between them.

  .. py:method:: create_interconnect(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new interconnect between a AWS Direct Connect partner's network and a specific AWS Direct Connect location.

     

    An interconnect is a connection which is capable of hosting other connections. The AWS Direct Connect partner can use an interconnect to provide sub-1Gbps AWS Direct Connect service to tier 2 customers who do not have their own connections. Like a standard connection, an interconnect links the AWS Direct Connect partner's network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end is connected to the partner's router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router.

     

    You can automatically add the new interconnect to a link aggregation group (LAG) by specifying a LAG ID in the request. This ensures that the new interconnect is allocated on the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint that hosts the specified LAG. If there are no available ports on the endpoint, the request fails and no interconnect will be created.

     

    For each end customer, the AWS Direct Connect partner provisions a connection on their interconnect by calling AllocateConnectionOnInterconnect. The end customer can then connect to AWS resources by creating a virtual interface on their connection, using the VLAN assigned to them by the AWS Direct Connect partner.

     

    .. note::

       

      This is intended for use by AWS Direct Connect partners only.

A LAG is a logical interface that uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to aggregate multiple 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit interfaces, allowing you to treat them as a single interface.

     

    All connections in a LAG must use the same bandwidth (for example, 10 Gbps), and must terminate at the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint.

     

    You can have up to 10 connections per LAG. Regardless of this limit, if you request more connections for the LAG than AWS Direct Connect can allocate on a single endpoint, no LAG is created.

     

    You can specify an existing physical connection or interconnect to include in the LAG (which counts towards the total number of connections). Doing so interrupts the current physical connection or hosted connections, and re-establishes them as a member of the LAG. The LAG will be created on the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint to which the connection terminates. Any virtual interfaces associated with the connection are automatically disassociated and re-associated with the LAG. The connection ID does not change.

     

    If the AWS account used to create a LAG is a registered AWS Direct Connect partner, the LAG is automatically enabled to host sub-connections. For a LAG owned by a partner, any associated virtual interfaces cannot be directly configured.

  .. py:method:: create_public_virtual_interface(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new public virtual interface. A virtual interface is the VLAN that transports AWS Direct Connect traffic. A public virtual interface supports sending traffic to public services of AWS such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

     

    When creating an IPv6 public virtual interface (addressFamily is 'ipv6'), the customer and amazon address fields should be left blank to use auto-assigned IPv6 space. Custom IPv6 Addresses are currently not supported.

            An interconnect is a connection that can host other connections.

             

            Like a standard AWS Direct Connect connection, an interconnect represents the physical connection between an AWS Direct Connect partner's network and a specific Direct Connect location. An AWS Direct Connect partner who owns an interconnect can provision hosted connections on the interconnect for their end customers, thereby providing the end customers with connectivity to AWS services.

             

            The resources of the interconnect, including bandwidth and VLAN numbers, are shared by all of the hosted connections on the interconnect, and the owner of the interconnect determines how these resources are assigned.

  .. py:method:: disassociate_connection_from_lag(**kwargs)

    

    Disassociates a connection from a link aggregation group (LAG). The connection is interrupted and re-established as a standalone connection (the connection is not deleted; to delete the connection, use the  DeleteConnection request). If the LAG has associated virtual interfaces or hosted connections, they remain associated with the LAG. A disassociated connection owned by an AWS Direct Connect partner is automatically converted to an interconnect.

     

    If disassociating the connection will cause the LAG to fall below its setting for minimum number of operational connections, the request fails, except when it's the last member of the LAG. If all connections are disassociated, the LAG continues to exist as an empty LAG with no physical connections.

  .. py:method:: update_lag(**kwargs)

    

    Updates the attributes of a link aggregation group (LAG). 

     

    You can update the following attributes: 

     

     
    * The name of the LAG. 
     
    * The value for the minimum number of connections that must be operational for the LAG itself to be operational.  
     

     

    When you create a LAG, the default value for the minimum number of operational connections is zero (0). If you update this value, and the number of operational connections falls below the specified value, the LAG will automatically go down to avoid overutilization of the remaining connections. Adjusting this value should be done with care as it could force the LAG down if the value is set higher than the current number of operational connections.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        Describes a link aggregation group (LAG). A LAG is a connection that uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to logically aggregate a bundle of physical connections. Like an interconnect, it can host other connections. All connections in a LAG must terminate on the same physical AWS Direct Connect endpoint, and must be the same bandwidth.

        
        

        - **connectionsBandwidth** *(string) --* 

          The individual bandwidth of the physical connections bundled by the LAG.

           

          Available values: 1Gbps, 10Gbps

          
        

        - **numberOfConnections** *(integer) --* 

          The number of physical connections bundled by the LAG, up to a maximum of 10.

          
        

        - **lagId** *(string) --* 

          The ID of the LAG.

           

          Example: dxlag-fg5678gh

          
        

        - **ownerAccount** *(string) --*

        - **lagState** *(string) --* 

          The state of the LAG.

           

           
          * **Requested** : The initial state of a LAG. The LAG stays in the requested state until the Letter of Authorization (LOA) is available. 
           
          * **Pending** : The LAG has been approved, and is being initialized. 
           
          * **Available** : The network link is established, and the LAG is ready for use. 
           
          * **Down** : The network link is down. 
           
          * **Deleting** : The LAG is in the process of being deleted. 
           
          * **Deleted** : The LAG has been deleted.

        - **minimumLinks** *(integer) --* 

          The minimum number of physical connections that must be operational for the LAG itself to be operational. If the number of operational connections drops below this setting, the LAG state changes to ``down`` . This value can help to ensure that a LAG is not overutilized if a significant number of its bundled connections go down.

          
        

        - **awsDevice** *(string) --*
