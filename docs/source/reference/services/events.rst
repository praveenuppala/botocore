  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: delete_rule(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes the specified rule.

     

    You must remove all targets from a rule using  RemoveTargets before you can delete the rule.

     

    When you delete a rule, incoming events might continue to match to the deleted rule. Please allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.

                Currently, we support including only one RunCommandTarget block, which specifies either an array of InstanceIds or a tag.

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  Information about the EC2 instances that are to be sent the command, specified as key-value pairs. Each ``RunCommandTarget`` block can include only one key, but this key may specify multiple values.

                  
                  

                  - **Key** *(string) --*

                  - **Values** *(list) --* 

                    If ``Key`` is ``tag:``  *tag-key* , ``Values`` is a list of tag values. If ``Key`` is ``InstanceIds`` , ``Values`` is a list of Amazon EC2 instance IDs.

            - **EcsParameters** *(dict) --* 

              Contains the Amazon ECS task definition and task count to be used, if the event target is an Amazon ECS task. For more information about Amazon ECS tasks, see `Task Definitions <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_defintions.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Container Service Developer Guide* .

              
              

              - **TaskDefinitionArn** *(string) --* 

                The ARN of the task definition to use if the event target is an Amazon ECS cluster. 

                
              

              - **TaskCount** *(integer) --* 

                The number of tasks to create based on the ``TaskDefinition`` . The default is one.

                
          
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          Indicates whether there are additional results to retrieve. If there are no more results, the value is null.

  .. py:method:: put_permission(**kwargs)

    

    Running ``PutPermission`` permits the specified AWS account to put events to your account's default *event bus* . CloudWatch Events rules in your account are triggered by these events arriving to your default event bus. 

     

    For another account to send events to your account, that external account must have a CloudWatch Events rule with your account's default event bus as a target.

     

    To enable multiple AWS accounts to put events to your default event bus, run ``PutPermission`` once for each of these accounts.

     

    The permission policy on the default event bus cannot exceed 10KB in size.

          Principal='string',
          StatementId='string'
      )
    :type Action: string
    :param Action: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The action that you are enabling the other account to perform. Currently, this must be ``events:PutEvents`` .

      

    
    :type Principal: string
    :param Principal: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The 12-digit AWS account ID that you are permitting to put events to your default event bus. Specify "*" to permit any account to put events to your default event bus.

       

      If you specify "*", avoid creating rules that may match undesirable events. To create more secure rules, make sure that the event pattern for each rule contains an ``account`` field with a specific account ID from which to receive events. Rules with an account field do not match any events sent from other accounts.

      

    
    :type StatementId: string
    :param StatementId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      An identifier string for the external account that you are granting permissions to. If you later want to revoke the permission for this external account, specify this ``StatementId`` when you run  RemovePermission .

      

    
    
    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: put_rule(**kwargs)

    

    Creates or updates the specified rule. Rules are enabled by default, or based on value of the state. You can disable a rule using  DisableRule .

     

    When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately start matching to new or updated rules. Please allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.

     

    A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules with EventPatterns are triggered when a matching event is observed. Rules with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on a schedule.

     

    Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However, CloudWatch Events uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match.

  .. py:method:: put_targets(**kwargs)

    

    Adds the specified targets to the specified rule, or updates the targets if they are already associated with the rule.

     

    Targets are the resources that are invoked when a rule is triggered.

     

    You can configure the following as targets for CloudWatch Events:

     

     
    * EC2 instances 
     
    * AWS Lambda functions 
     
    * Streams in Amazon Kinesis Streams 
     
    * Delivery streams in Amazon Kinesis Firehose 
     
    * Amazon ECS tasks 
     
    * AWS Step Functions state machines 
     
    * Pipelines in Amazon Code Pipeline 
     
    * Amazon Inspector assessment templates 
     
    * Amazon SNS topics 
     
    * Amazon SQS queues 
     
    * The default event bus of another AWS account 
     

     

    Note that creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the AWS Management Console.

     

    For some target types, ``PutTargets`` provides target-specific parameters. If the target is an Amazon Kinesis stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the ``KinesisParameters`` argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the ``RunCommandParameters`` field.

     

    To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon CloudWatch Events needs the appropriate permissions. For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, CloudWatch Events relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Amazon Kinesis streams, and AWS Step Functions state machines, CloudWatch Events relies on IAM roles that you specify in the ``RoleARN`` argument in ``PutTargets`` . For more information, see `Authentication and Access Control <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/auth-and-access-control-cwe.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide* .

     

    If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using ``PutPermission`` ), you can send events to that account by setting that account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the ``Arn`` when you run ``PutTargets`` . If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to antoher account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged. For more information on pricing, see `Amazon CloudWatch Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/>`__ .

     

    For more information about enabling cross-account events, see  PutPermission .

     

     **Input** , **InputPath** and **InputTransformer** are mutually exclusive and optional parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event:

     

     
    * If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, then the entire event is passed to the target in JSON form (unless the target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case nothing from the event is passed to the target). 
     
    * If **Input** is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event is overridden with this constant. 
     
    * If **InputPath** is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, ``$.detail`` ), then only the part of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (for example, only the detail part of the event is passed). 
     
    * If **InputTransformer** is specified, then one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from the event and used as values in a template that you specify as the input to the target. 
     

     

    When you specify ``Input`` , ``InputPath`` , or ``InputTransformer`` , you must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation.

     

    When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after, new or updated targets might not be immediately invoked. Please allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.

     

    This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time. If that happens, ``FailedEntryCount`` is non-zero in the response and each entry in ``FailedEntries`` provides the ID of the failed target and the error code.

  .. py:method:: remove_permission(**kwargs)

    

    Revokes the permission of another AWS account to be able to put events to your default event bus. Specify the account to revoke by the ``StatementId`` value that you associated with the account when you granted it permission with ``PutPermission`` . You can find the ``StatementId`` by using  DescribeEventBus .

  .. py:method:: remove_targets(**kwargs)

    

    Removes the specified targets from the specified rule. When the rule is triggered, those targets are no longer be invoked.

     

    When you remove a target, when the associated rule triggers, removed targets might continue to be invoked. Please allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.

     

    This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time. If that happens, ``FailedEntryCount`` is non-zero in the response and each entry in ``FailedEntries`` provides the ID of the failed target and the error code.

  .. py:method:: test_event_pattern(**kwargs)

    

    Tests whether the specified event pattern matches the provided event.

     

    Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However, CloudWatch Events uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match.
