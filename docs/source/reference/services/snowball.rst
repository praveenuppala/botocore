  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: cancel_cluster(**kwargs)

    

    Cancels a cluster job. You can only cancel a cluster job while it's in the ``AwaitingQuorum`` status. You'll have at least an hour after creating a cluster job to cancel it.

  .. py:method:: cancel_job(**kwargs)

    

    Cancels the specified job. You can only cancel a job before its ``JobState`` value changes to ``PreparingAppliance`` . Requesting the ``ListJobs`` or ``DescribeJob`` action will return a job's ``JobState`` as part of the response element data returned.

  .. py:method:: create_address(**kwargs)

    

    Creates an address for a Snowball to be shipped to. In most regions, addresses are validated at the time of creation. The address you provide must be located within the serviceable area of your region. If the address is invalid or unsupported, then an exception is thrown.

  .. py:method:: create_job(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a job to import or export data between Amazon S3 and your on-premises data center. Your AWS account must have the right trust policies and permissions in place to create a job for Snowball. If you're creating a job for a node in a cluster, you only need to provide the ``clusterId`` value; the other job attributes are inherited from the cluster.

  .. py:method:: generate_presigned_url(ClientMethod, Params=None, ExpiresIn=3600, HttpMethod=None)

        
    Generate a presigned url given a client, its method, and arguments
    
    :type ClientMethod: string
    :param ClientMethod: The client method to presign for
    
    :type Params: dict
    :param Params: The parameters normally passed to
        ``ClientMethod``.
    
    :type ExpiresIn: int
    :param ExpiresIn: The number of seconds the presigned url is valid
        for. By default it expires in an hour (3600 seconds)
    
    :type HttpMethod: string
    :param HttpMethod: The http method to use on the generated url. By
        default, the http method is whatever is used in the method's model.
    
    :returns: The presigned url


  .. py:method:: get_job_manifest(**kwargs)

    

    Returns a link to an Amazon S3 presigned URL for the manifest file associated with the specified ``JobId`` value. You can access the manifest file for up to 60 minutes after this request has been made. To access the manifest file after 60 minutes have passed, you'll have to make another call to the ``GetJobManifest`` action.

     

    The manifest is an encrypted file that you can download after your job enters the ``WithCustomer`` status. The manifest is decrypted by using the ``UnlockCode`` code value, when you pass both values to the Snowball through the Snowball client when the client is started for the first time.

     

    As a best practice, we recommend that you don't save a copy of an ``UnlockCode`` value in the same location as the manifest file for that job. Saving these separately helps prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the Snowball associated with that job.

     

    The credentials of a given job, including its manifest file and unlock code, expire 90 days after the job is created.
